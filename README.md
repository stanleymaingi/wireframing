# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the design process that focuses on creating a visual blueprint of a digital product before full development begins. It represents the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a user interface without detailed design elements such as colors or images.

## Importance of Wireframing

Wireframing is important because it helps designers and developers plan the layout and user flow early in the project. It allows teams to identify usability issues, clarify requirements, and align stakeholders on the overall structure of the product. By using wireframes, teams can save time and resources by making changes early, before development becomes costly.
